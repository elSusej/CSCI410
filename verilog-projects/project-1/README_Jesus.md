Notes: The abstraction that took place when going from a 2 way MUX, to a 4 way MUX, and finally to an 8 way MUX was interesting. Namely, only needing to use the MSB of the select input to differentiate between subsequent MUXes worked well and was simple to understand. Additionally, the 8-way OR gate helped clear up some misconceptions that I had concerning generate loops. Simply put, they are used to instantiate multiple identical hardware instances.
